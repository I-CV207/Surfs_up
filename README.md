# Surfs up

## Overview
The main goal of this analysis is to determine through historical data the behavior of weather. We are using the temperature  data from June and December to get the statistic summary of each of them in order to compare the results between them and determine if is viable to open a surf and ice cream shop.

## Results

From the performed analysis we got the following results:

1. The average temperature in the month of June is 74.94 F (24 C), in December the average temperature is 71.04 (22 C) as seen on the images below, the difference may not be that different when it comes to the average temperatures or standar deviation wich shows that the weather does not fluctate that much.

2. The maximum recorded temperatures are not that different between each other neither but the minimum recorded temperatures do show a considerable difference, nevertheless this maximum and minimum temperatures are "outliners" as seen in the graphs shown below.

3. As seen on the graphs below, most of days from June are among 70 F and 80 F, meanwhile December most days the temperature is between 67 F and 75 F.

## Summary

Based on the results we can conclude that even if the temperatures in december are lower than the temperatures recorded on june the difference is not that significant to consider the month of December as a "cold" month, the temperatures remain between a range that could be consider as ideal to open a surf shop or an ice cream shop.

In addtion to the information that was already analysed more information related to weather could be retrieved to do a deeper analysis, some additional queries could be:

- Precipitation querries from June and December.
- Temperature queries from the rest of the months.
